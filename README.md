# OpenAudible to AudioBookShelf

This script automates the process of moving audiobook files from OpenAudible or Libation to an organized folder structure and updates AudioBookShelf accordingly. It handles file organization, metadata mapping, and interaction with the AudioBookShelf API.

## Features

* **Automated File Organization:** Organizes audiobooks into a structured directory based on author and series.
* **Multiple Download Sources:** Supports both OpenAudible and Libation as download sources.
* **Metadata Mapping:** Extracts relevant metadata from JSON files generated by either OpenAudible or Libation.
* **AudioBookShelf Integration:** Scans the library, matches books with Audible, and updates AudioBookShelf.
* **File Management:** Optionally cleans up source folders after processing (for Libation).
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Provides informative logging and error messages.
* **Desktop Notifications:** Uses notify-send to display processing status.
* **Configurable:** Allows customization through command-line arguments.
* **CLI or YAML Arguments:** Accepts either CLI flags or a yaml file with arguments

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
* **Required Python Packages:** Install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* **OpenAudible or Libation:** This script assumes you have either OpenAudible or Libation installed and configured.
* **AudioBookShelf:** You need a running instance of AudioBookShelf and its API details.
* **notify-send:** For desktop notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Libation does not export it's library by default. Currently you need to export this yourself
> ```
> libationcli export --path $HOME/libation/libation.json --json
> ```
> In the future this may be done automatically for you

## Usage

The script can be run from the command line with various arguments or using a YAML configuration file. Here are examples for both methods:

## Workflow

1. **Export Book Data:** Export your OpenAudible or Libation library as a JSON file. 
> [!NOTE]
> OpenAudible does this automatically when you first login.
> Libation does not export it's library by default. Currently you need to export this yourself
> ```
> libationcli export --path $HOME/libation/libation.json --json
> ```
> In the future this may be done automatically for you
 
2. **Configuration:** Set the required command-line arguments or use a YAML configuration file.
3. **Execution:** Run the script. It will:
   * Process books purchased within the specified timeframe
   * Move audiobook files to the organized directory structure
   * Scan the AudioBookShelf library
   * Match the moved books in AudioBookShelf with Audible metadata
4. **Review Logs:** Check the log file for any errors or information about the processed books.

## File Organization

The script organizes audiobooks in the following structure:
```
destination_dir/
├── Author_Name/
│   ├── Series_Name/
│   │   └── Book_Title/
│   │       └── audiobook_file.m4b
│   └── Standalone_Book/
│       └── audiobook_file.m4b
└── Another_Author/
    └── ...
```
